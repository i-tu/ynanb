# ynanb - You Need a Nordea Budget

This is a simple Python 3 script to convert exported Nordea transactions to [YNAB CSV format](http://classic.youneedabudget.com/support/article/csv-file-importing).

Perhaps it will be useful to other clients of Nordea bank.

Inspired by [ynamb](https://github.com/keepwatch/ynamb).
